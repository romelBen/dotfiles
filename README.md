# Dotfiles for Mac Environment
Here is my configuration which was heavily influenced by a person named geerlingguy. The configurations are ONLY supported for Mac environments.

One of my projects that uses this environment can be found in my directory `ansible-scripts` of [mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/romelBen/devop_projects/tree/master/scripting-projects/ansible-scripts/mac-dev-playbook). The script allows you to configure your Mac environment from scratch using Ansible. The installation will incorporate the dotfiles.
